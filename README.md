# PicShare App - Expo(TypeScript)

I inspired by https://dribbble.com/shots/5529409-Photography-Motion / www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiAdt9-wNJo&t and tried to create something like that using different animation libraries in React Native. I have used Shared Element transition, Animatable and Touchable Scale in this project.
